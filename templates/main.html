      <h1>Django Web Framework</h1>
      <hr>
          <p>Django, a powerful web framework built on Python, stands tall as a frontrunner in the world of web development. Originally developed by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison in 2003, Django has evolved into a robust, open-source framework that simplifies and streamlines the creation of web applications.

            At its core, Django emphasizes the principle of "batteries included," offering a comprehensive set of tools and functionalities right out of the box. Its design revolves around the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and MVC (Model-View-Controller) principles, enabling developers to create applications quickly and efficiently while maintaining clean and maintainable code.
            
            One of Django's standout features is its emphasis on reusability and modularity. The framework is composed of several independent components, or "apps," allowing developers to build upon existing functionality or create new features without reinventing the wheel. This modularity not only enhances productivity but also promotes a structured and scalable approach to web development.

            <h1>Django Rest Framework</h1>
            <hr>
                <p> 
                  Django Rest Framework (DRF) is a powerful toolkit for building web APIs using Django, the popular Python web framework. It simplifies API development by providing robust features like serialization, authentication, and viewsets. DRF leverages Django's functionality to create RESTful APIs effortlessly, allowing developers to define models, serializers, and views to handle HTTP requests and responses.

Its serialization mechanism transforms complex data types, like Django models, into native Python data types suitable for rendering into JSON, XML, or other content types. Authentication support includes built-in options for session-based authentication, token authentication, OAuth, and more. DRF's viewsets and routers streamline URL routing, reducing repetitive code and enabling quick API configuration.

Additionally, DRF offers extensive documentation, tutorials, and a supportive community. Its flexibility, performance, and comprehensive toolset make it a go-to choice for crafting robust and scalable web APIs in Django, making API development smoother and more efficient.

                <h1>Security in Django</h1>
                <hr>

                <p>
                  This document is an overview of Django’s security features. It includes advice on securing a Django-powered site.
                  
                  Cross site scripting (XSS) protection¶
                  XSS attacks allow a user to inject client side scripts into the browsers of other users. This is usually achieved by storing the malicious scripts in the database where it will be retrieved and displayed to other users, or by getting users to click a link which will cause the attacker’s JavaScript to be executed by the user’s browser. However, XSS attacks can originate from any untrusted source of data, such as cookies or web services, whenever the data is not sufficiently sanitized before including in a page.
                  
                  Using Django templates protects you against the majority of XSS attacks. However, it is important to understand what protections it provides and its limitations.
                  
                  Django templates escape specific characters which are particularly dangerous to HTML. While this protects users from most malicious input, it is not entirely foolproof. For example, it will not protect the following:
                  
                  
                  If var is set to 'class1 onmouseover=javascript:func()', this can result in unauthorized JavaScript execution, depending on how the browser renders imperfect HTML. (Quoting the attribute value would fix this case.)
                  
                  It is also important to be particularly careful when using is_safe with custom template tags, the safe template tag, mark_safe, and when autoescape is turned off.
                  
                  In addition, if you are using the template system to output something other than HTML, there may be entirely separate characters and words which require escaping.
                  
                  You should also be very careful when storing HTML in the database, especially when that HTML is retrieved and displayed.
                  
                  Cross site request forgery (CSRF) protection¶
                  CSRF attacks allow a malicious user to execute actions using the credentials of another user without that user’s knowledge or consent.
                  
                  Django has built-in protection against most types of CSRF attacks, providing you have enabled and used it where appropriate. However, as with any mitigation technique, there are limitations. For example, it is possible to disable the CSRF module globally or for particular views. You should only do this if you know what you are doing. There are other limitations if your site has subdomains that are outside of your control.
                  
                  CSRF protection works by checking for a secret in each POST request. This ensures that a malicious user cannot “replay” a form POST to your website and have another logged in user unwittingly submit that form. The malicious user would have to know the secret, which is user specific (using a cookie).
                  
                  When deployed with HTTPS, CsrfViewMiddleware will check that the HTTP referer header is set to a URL on the same origin (including subdomain and port). Because HTTPS provides additional security, it is imperative to ensure connections use HTTPS where it is available by forwarding insecure connection requests and using HSTS for supported browsers.
                  
                  Be very careful with marking views with the csrf_exempt decorator unless it is absolutely necessary.
                  
                  SQL injection protection¶
                  SQL injection is a type of attack where a malicious user is able to execute arbitrary SQL code on a database. This can result in records being deleted or data leakage.
                  
                  Django’s querysets are protected from SQL injection since their queries are constructed using query parameterization. A query’s SQL code is defined separately from the query’s parameters. Since parameters may be user-provided and therefore unsafe, they are escaped by the underlying database driver.
                  
                  Django also gives developers power to write raw queries or execute custom sql. These capabilities should be used sparingly and you should always be careful to properly escape any parameters that the user can control. In addition, you should exercise caution when using extra() and RawSQL.
                  
                  Clickjacking protection¶
                  Clickjacking is a type of attack where a malicious site wraps another site in a frame. This attack can result in an unsuspecting user being tricked into performing unintended actions on the target site.
                  
                  Django contains clickjacking protection in the form of the X-Frame-Options middleware which in a supporting browser can prevent a site from being rendered inside a frame. It is possible to disable the protection on a per view basis or to configure the exact header value sent.
                  
                  The middleware is strongly recommended for any site that does not need to have its pages wrapped in a frame by third party sites, or only needs to allow that for a small section of the site.
                  
                  
                  
                  Consider serving static files from a cloud service or CDN to avoid some of these issues.
                  
                  If your site accepts file uploads, it is strongly advised that you limit these uploads in your web server configuration to a reasonable size in order to prevent denial of service (DOS) attacks. In Apache, this can be easily set using the LimitRequestBody directive.
                  
                  If you are serving your own static files, be sure that handlers like Apache’s mod_php, which would execute static files as code, are disabled. You don’t want users to be able to execute arbitrary code by uploading and requesting a specially crafted file.
                  
                  Django’s media upload handling poses some vulnerabilities when that media is served in ways that do not follow security best practices. Specifically, an HTML file can be uploaded as an image if that file contains a valid PNG header followed by malicious HTML. This file will pass verification of the library that Django uses for ImageField image processing (Pillow). When this file is subsequently displayed to a user, it may be displayed as HTML depending on the type and configuration of your web server.
